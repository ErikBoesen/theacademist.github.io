STEAM. Everywhere STEAM.

The acronym STEM stands for Science, Technology, Education, and Math. The phrase has been used since its coining by Dr. Judith Ramaley of the NSF to refer to these four areas of education as a bloc. More recently, some educators and activists have advocated that A, standing for Arts, be added to the acronym to form STEAM.

Last month, I spoke in Virginia's House of Delegates, first in the committee on Science and Technology ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Sz1ufm_ss)) and later in the Appropriations subcommittee on Education (no video taken), in support of HB1111. That bill, should it have passed, would have created incentives for private corporations to provide funding for *STEAM* programs to economically disadvantaged Virginian schools. (Economically disadvantaged, in this context, was defined as those with at least 40% of students participating in free and reduced lunch programs.)

That bill, HB1111, was modeled after the 2017 session's SB17, which offered government funds to help underserved schools run STEM programs, as well as existing provisions in the Virginia Code which have a similar effect but will expire this summer.

I sympathize with the desire to improve arts education. Truly, I do. But I think merging that area of study into STEM could be deeply hurt our educational system.

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math were originally grouped
