Hundreds of protesters are swarmed by police in the rural South Korean town of Seongju. What used to be a peaceful town with many elderly residents is now a battleground for the anti-THAAD movement led by Seongju’s very own citizens. As the protesters chant in unison, waves of police officers try to suppress the frenzy; officers and protesters are entangled on a crowded dirt road, breaking windows and injuring others in the process. These intense demonstrations have been occurring since late 2016, accumulating more zeal as time goes on. From arrests to injuries to a protester setting himself on fire—eventually causing his own death— the movement is becoming more integrated in world—not just South Korea—politics by the day.

The hoopla seems to be even more incomprehensible when you learn that South Koreans are protesting an anti-missile system, a technological asset that many would view as vital for South Korean national security in a time of rising tensions with powerful and volatile countries such as China and North Korea. Why is the THAAD anti-missile system such a schismatic issue, encompassing everyone from farmers to elite lawmakers?

THAAD, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, is an anti-missile system currently deployed in South Korea. Built by American manufacturer Lockheed Martin and deployed in conjunction with the United States, the missile system is supposed to enhance South Korean security and deter North Korean aggression.

However, THAAD may be doing just the opposite.

What Lockheed and South Korean rhetoric fail to tell you is that North Korean aggression has actually _increased_ since the announcement to deploy THAAD. North Korea first threatened to turn South Korea into a "sea of fire and a pile of ashes" and then proceeded to accelerate its missile and nuclear development program. One day after the announcement, North Korea tested a Pukkusong-1 (KN-11) SLBM, followed by three short range missiles six days afterwards. However, the hostilities did not end there. With North Korea’s sixth nuclear test in September 2017, South Korean national security advisor Chung Eui-yong released a statement expecting future North Korean provocations to occur well into October.

Another reservation about the infamous anti-missile system seems to be even more shocking: THAAD doesn’t work.

According to Eric Gomez, policy analyst for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, "THAAD is not able to defend Seoul from North Korean missiles because most of the capital city is just outside the 200 km range of THAAD’s interceptors," leaving Seoul’s 26 million citizens—more than half the population of the country—vulnerable to North Korean artillery and missiles. Additionally, THAAD is incapable of intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles—a weapon successfully tested by North Korea in summer 2017—nor short-range missiles—better known as Scuds—which North Korea is known to possess in high volume. To top it off, while Lockheed boasts of THAAD’s 19/19 test record, James Dwyer, teaching fellow and PhD candidate of the Politics and International Relations Program at the University of Tasmania, THAAD "tests are conducted in favourable conditions – and it is reasonable to expect the success rates to be lower in actual combat use."

If THAAD isn’t doing what it was built to do, what is the purpose of its presence, if not to de-escalate regional tensions and prevent a second Korean war?  

The harsh reality is that THAAD serves no purpose at all, other than to secure the United States’ regional foothold at the expense of South Korean autonomy. Rather than listen to the voices of its 50 million citizens, South Korea continues to appease the foreign superpower at no benefit of its own. Prolonged submission will further reinforce South Korea’s unhealthy reliance on the U.S., compromising the interests of its national security and the interests of its citizens in the long-run.

In the coming months, South Korea must reevaluate the role of THAAD, not just as an anti-missile system, but as a cornerstone of South Korean economic, political, and diplomatic ties and decide whether the tremendous costs are worth the negligible benefits.
