Quoth Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors; "whoever controls the media, controls the mind."

In a period of time during which great volumes of media, both independent and centrally owned, flow into the minds of the world populace from print and the internet, countless voices are accessible. Those on the left, right, center, top, bottom, and elsewhere have built [their](https://nationalreview.com) [own](https://thinkprogress.org/) [outlets](https://everydayfeminism.com/) [in](http://www.dailywire.com/) [which](https://www.economist.com/) [they](https://www.csmonitor.com) [have](http://www.theblaze.com/) [made](https://www.dailykos.com/) [their](https://www.prageru.com/) [voices](http://www.breitbart.com/) [heard](https://www.nytimes.com/).

One voice missing from this body of information is that of the secondary or high school student. There are means of journalistic expression for students at these levels, mostly through school newspapers. However, the focus of those publications is typically on the schools which they represent, and quality of content can be mixed. Many schools engage in broad censorship, prohibiting commentary on potentially sensitive topics. Thus, it's difficult for students to have an officialized voice in the media. We believe that this lack of accessible self-expression is a significant issue, and one we intend to rectify.

By starting _The Academist_, we intend to create an environment where students can express complicated opinions and ideas about topics which are important to them, whilst adhering to the stringent quality standards of conventional intellectual journalism

Further, we do not endorse any political position, as do some youth journalism aggregators. Rather, we will take a stance of neutrality and allow contributors to provide their own opinions. As we're not affiliated with an educational institution, we're not obligated to censor sensitive content. We will publish commentary on political issues, news, societal issues, technology, and anything else relevant to the world public. No topic is off limits.

Launching news websites is not an easy task, and dedication from many parties will be required. If you have an interest in a topic and would like to make your ideas known, or if you have written material worthy of inclusion in _The Academist_, we want your contributions.
