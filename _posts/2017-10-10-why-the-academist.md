Quoth Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors; "whoever controls the media, controls the mind."

In a period of time during which great volumes of media, both independent and centrally owned, flow into the minds of the world populace from print and the internet, countless voices are accessible. Those on the left, right, center, top, bottom, and elsewhere have built [their](https://nationalreview.com) [own](https://thinkprogress.org/) [outlets](https://everydayfeminism.com/) [in](http://www.dailywire.com/) [which](https://www.economist.com/) [they](https://www.csmonitor.com) [have](http://www.theblaze.com/) [made](https://www.dailykos.com/) [their](https://www.prageru.com/) [voices](http://www.breitbart.com/) [heard](https://www.nytimes.com/).

One voice missing from this body of information is that of the secondary or high school student. There are means of journalistic expression for students at these levels, mostly through school newspapers. However, the focus of those publications is typically on the schools which they represent, and quality of content can be mixed.

By starting _The Academist_, we intend to create an environment where students can express complicated opinions and ideas about topics which are important to them, whilst adhering to the stringent quality standards of conventional intellectual journalism.

Further, we do not endorse any political position, as do some youth journalism aggregators. Rather, we will take a stance of neutrality and allow contributors to provide their own opinions. The overarching goal for this project is to create an environment where students can voice their ideas publicly.

Launching news sources is not an easy task, and dedication from many parties will be required. If you have an interest in a topic and would like to make your ideas known, or if you have written material worthy of inclusion in _The Academist_, we want your contributions.
