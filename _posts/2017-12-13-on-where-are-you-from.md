Recently I was referred to [this MTV episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igWYMo4z2OQ), a comedic short which advocates against asking the question "where are you from?" in certain contexts. While I'm sure the short was intended to positively influence discourse, I'm bothered by some of the implicit conclusions it endorses.

The video argues that by asking about someone's ethnic origin, the asker is putting the askee "into a box," and automatically assigning stereotypes based on the response.

I admit I've asked this question quite frequently. However, my motivations for doing so have nothing to do with categorization or forming stereotypes. When I ask this question, I ask it because I am fascinated by the nations of the world, and also am enthusiastic about how my community and, often, country draws together people from diverse cultures and geographic origins.

Taiye Selasi gave an incredible [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/taiye_selasi_don_t_ask_where_i_m_from_ask_where_i_m_a_local) on this subject. In the talk, she argued against the idea of identifying someone's nation of origin in order to holistically describe their background. Her ideas push me to clarify that if and when I ask this question of anyone, I don't mean to request a specific form of answer -- I'm wondering, as Mrs. Selasi insightfully states, where that person considers themselves a local.

If they want to refer to themselves as Laotian, that's fine. "Born here, with some family in Germany years ago?" Also interesting.

Displaying interest in someone's geographic origin—national or otherwise—is not an act of racism. We ought to avoid turning curiosity into prejudice.
