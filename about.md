There are many intellectual news media online. From the New York Times to the Wall Street Journal to the Christian Science Monitor to the National Review, there's no shortage of organizations and papers filled with opinions, ideas, and arguments from every corner of the political spectrum.

There are also many student newspapers. Though they are less common than they used to be and valuable commentary is occasional at best, they represent an important and populationally significant demographic whose voices are rarely present in political and social discourse.

The Academist aims to bridge the gap between these two forms of media, providing an outlet for the voices of adolescents while maintaining the high standard of quality that would be expected ot a reputable news organization. The Academist both publishes original content and republishes articles and media from school newspapers, often with linguistic revisions.
